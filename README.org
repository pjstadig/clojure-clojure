* clojure-clojure
  Clojure's abstractions written in Clojure.

  My goal is to replace much of Clojure's Java code with Clojure code--much but
  not all.  This isn't Clojure-in-Clojure.  I do not expect to replace the
  Clojure compiler, nor do I expect to implement Var, IFn, the STM, and many
  other bits of Java code.
